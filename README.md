# Todo_List

To do list built using React JS.

This app was built while following the tutorial by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLHFPt9B2Os&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ&index=9)

Note: One directory called "node_modules" is not included in this repository as a result of its large file size. It is the default node_modules directory that is created when you create an Expo app.

# Inspiration

I want to start developing applications using React JS. I am using this project as a way to learn fundamental concepts. 

# Deploying the app

1. Download this repository on your computer and extract the files.
2. Go to [Expo](https://expo.io/learn) and install Expo.
3. Create an Expo project by writing "expo init myApp"
4. Take the node_modules directory from your myApp project and transfer the directory to this project's directory on your computer. (Path: ~/Reviews_App/)
5. Enter the Reviews_App directory using "cd" and once inside, write "expo start" or "npm start".
6. You can then deploy the application on the web, iOS, or Android. You may have to consult turotials on Youtube for help on this step.
7. Enjoy :))
